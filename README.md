# Network Share

Share files in realtime within the same network. WIP

## TODO

- [x] Docker setup
- [x] express cors stuff
- [x] List connected users
- [ ] better user interactivity (success, error states)
- [ ] install docs

## Disclaimer

I know there's a ton of other repositories out there that do the same!
I wanted to learn more so decided to make my own!
